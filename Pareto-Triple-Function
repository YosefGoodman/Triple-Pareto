The YosefBunick Function is a scaled Pareto-inspired function with hyperbolic growth, sigmoid smoothing, and built-in normalization. 
It’s designed for modeling cumulative behavior across percentile inputs
especially when data is imbalanced, sparse, or exhibits fat-tailed risk dynamics.
Mathematically, the function combines:
A hyperbolic power term: Pareto-like heavy tail behavior
A sigmoid term: logistic smoothing of growth
A TANH component: for soft transitions in midrange
A final normalization step to constrain outputs from zero to one 

This construction makes it suitable for robust scoring systems, synthetic distribution modeling, 
and anywhere a percentile-to-impact curve must remain monotonic, stable, and tunable.

F(p) = ((A4 * (1 - p)^(-A5)) * A8 * (tanh(p) + A1 / (1 + exp(-A2 * p))) - A6) / (A7 - A6)
F(p) = L * (w1 * TANH(a1 * (p - b1)) + w2 * (1 + EXP(-a2 * (p - b2)))^(-1)) + c

| Parameter | Name                     | Description                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `A1`      | Sigmoid Weight           | Controls the strength of the sigmoid smoothing term. Higher values increase its influence on the overall curve.             |
| `A2`      | Sigmoid Steepness        | Determines how sharply the sigmoid term transitions from 0 to 1. Larger values result in a steeper S-curve.                 |
| `A4`      | Hyperbolic Scale         | Affects the amplitude of the hyperbolic growth. Sets the base "height" of the curve before normalization.                   |
| `A5`      | Hyperbolic Curvature     | Governs the steepness of the curve as `p → 1`. Higher values simulate rare-event amplification (Pareto-like tail behavior). |
| `A6`      | Minimum Value (Pre-Norm) | The lowest possible raw output before normalization. Used for scaling the function into \[0, 1].                            |
| `A7`      | Maximum Value (Pre-Norm) | The highest possible raw output before normalization. Ensures consistent output range.                                      |
| `A8`      | Global Scaling Factor    | An optional constant or dynamic multiplier applied to the curve (e.g. 1/3 or 200/p depending on context).                   |

with a6 being 0 and a7 being 1 you can normalize the functiion from zero to one
a8 on the other hand when altered from the orginal 1/2 plus or minus .2-.3 seems to sugest the bounds to the losses. 

when comparing to the original form of pareto, this model proves to give more consisten results espectialy when bounded corectly. 
in current models after many itterations it was proven that keeping the rate of error at when the margin or error (ME) from 0 to 1 is 
S(p) = {
ME*    1 / p              if 0.80 ≤ p ≤ 1.00
ME*    200 / p            if 0.70 ≤ p < 0.80
ME*    1 - p              if 0.47 ≤ p < 0.70
ME*    200 / p            if 0.42 ≤ p < 0.47
ME*    200 / p            if 0.00 ≤ p < 0.42
